# Title

Dive in the Heart of Chicago crime


# Abstract

The iconic city of Chicago (Illinois), is widely known for it's crime. Surnamed Chirac because of it's crime rate comparable to the war in Irak, also known for Al Capone and it's Chicago outfit during the prohibition, Fred Hampton's assasination by the city's police, or the suddent rise of crime in 2015 make Chicago Crime an intersting subject to study.

Through this study of 20 years of crime, we want to bring insights on the crime evolution, geographical distribution and effects on the city with an unbiased and apolitical aproach with the goal to give people an fair idea of the safety of the city and it's implications.

Also, we think that a good analysis of crime through cities with endemic criminaly such as Chicago can be an usefull tool for police (to prevent crime), law makers (judge cases with insights from similar events), touristic office (give an information about areas to avoid, at what time).


# Research questions

- Is the violence evenly spread accross the city or are some districts more concerned with violence? We think that some areas might be more subject to violence and crime. 

- Is there an evolution thoughout the years of the violence in each neighborhood? Did some area manage to handle crime better than others?

- Correlate some factors that correspond to quality of life (green area, quality of education, quality of restaurants, price of real estate) and their respective area with crimes? We would like to see if areas concerned with violence are similar to areas with high number of failed food inspections. Indeed, there might be more failed food inspections in poorer districts than richer ones.

- Are violent areas ghettos (no-go zones)? We can speculate that people do not go to violent area and services (taxis) tend to avoid them as well. Using the taxi courses dataset we could analyze if people go to areas with high crime rate and if taxis take courses from such areas (we can perform the same analysis with bicycle trips.

- Is there any correlation between the densitiy of fire and police stations and the amount of crimes in certain areas of Chicago ?

- Are there more towed vehicules in considered less dangerous zones where the average salary might be higher so people care less of having their vehicules towed ? Or in the countrary it is in the dangerous areas where illegality is more present ?

# Dataset

- [Chicago Crimes](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-crime):
This dataset records crimes committed in the past 20 years in Chicago. We have access to the year, time, location, type of crime, district of each crime. We can thus make a geographical analysis to find concerned areas. We can see the evolution using the timestamp. 

- [Food Inspection in Chicaco](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-food-inspections):
This dataset records results of food inspection since 2010 in Chicago. We have access to the name and location of the food insitution, the results of the test. We can find areas that tend to fail inspections and see how they compare with crime rate.  It can tell us if crimes are located in areas with good restaurants (might be richer areas) or bad ones (might be poorer areas).

- [Chicago taxi rides in 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-taxi-rides-2016):
This dataset contains taxi rides data such as location of picking and dropping, time of the course. This would allow us to see which areas of the city are well connected and which areas tend to be excluded. We can then try to correlate the results with the violent areas. However this analysis can only be possible for the 2016 year.

- [Towed Vehicles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Towed-Vehicles/ygr5-vcbg):
This dataset provides the location of vehicules in Chicago that have been towed which means either illegally parked vehicules, abandoned vehicules and vehicles used for illegal activities. We can use this dataset to further our zone-oriented crime analysis with previous datasets.

- [Police Stations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Police-Stations/z8bn-74gv?fbclid=IwAR2yJeCXKd2toir7M50FkGWQ9MOZ7hrAD5ZMudAbiJE0vgriOIkw_d6y19Q)/[Fire Stations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Stations/28km-gtjn?fbclid=IwAR0SS0NRQiQoBv9fRFvIYgTfbqvL4sTAvKN_bbyXfsPCBeCJsTE_l72R8Vk):
This datasets provide locations of police stations and fire stations in chicago. We can use it to find out different location densities of them and try to group them and see if we get same results as with the crime locations.

- [Chicago public dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/):
This website contains publicy available datasets for the city of Chicago. It could be a great way to complete our analysis. We can find data regarding different aspects of the city such as education, real estate, environment, cleanness... Finding how violent zones differ from each other regarding other aspects might lead us to discover factors that reduce violence.

# Questions for TAs
Add here some questions you have for us, in general or project-specific.

- Should we restrict ourself to the crime dataset or is it a good idea to explore other Chicago related datasets (food inspections, taxis courses) to find correlations ?
