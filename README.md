# Abstract

_A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?_

The iconic city of Chicago (Illinois), is widely known for it's crime. Surmnamed Chirac because of it's crime rate comparable to the war in Irak, also known for Al Capone and it's Chicago outfit during the prohibition, Fred Hampton's assasination by the city's police, or the suddent rise of crime in 2015 make of Chicago's crime an intersting subject to study.

Through this study of the crime over 20 years, we want to bring insights on the crime evolution, geographical distribution and effects on the city with an unbiased and apolitical aproach to give people an fair idea of the safety of the city. 

We think that a good analysis of crime through endemic cities such as Chicago can be an usefull tool for police (prevent crime), law makers (judge cases with a good understand of similar events), touristic office (give an overview of areas to avoid, at what time). 

Chicago's city crime 



Through this study of the last 20 years, we will :


- Good place and bad places (identification of good/bad neighborhood

- Which neighborhood succeed

- Describe the evolution of crime rate per neighborhoods. Effect on crime rate to the geographical distribution of police stations. Does the violent from no-go-zone in the city (comparaison with taxi trips, bicycle ). 


- Correlation between violent area and neighborhood quality, through restaurant quality (inspection dataset), education (number of libraries dataset). Real estate. 

- 

# Research questions

- Is the violence evenly spread accross the city or are some districts more concerned with violence? We think that some areas might 

- Is there an evolution thoughout the years of the violence in each neighborhood? Did some area manage to handle crime better than others?

- Correlate some factors that correspond to quality of life (green area, quality of education, quality of restaurants, price of real estate) and their respective area with crimes? We would like to see if areas concerned with violence are similar to areas with high number of failed food inspections. Indeed, there might be more failed food inspections in poorer districts than richer ones.

- Are violent areas ghettos (no-go zones)? We can speculate that people do not go to violent area and services (taxis) tend to avoid them as well. Using the taxi courses dataset we could analyze if people go to areas with high crime rate and if taxis take courses from such areas.

# Dataset
_List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant._

- [Chicago Crimes](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-crime):
This dataset records crimes committed in the past 20 years in Chicago. We have access to the year, time, location, type of crime, district of each crime. We can thus make a geographical analysis to find concerned areas. We can see the evolution using the timestamp.

- [Food Inspection in Chicaco](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-food-inspections):
This dataset records results of food inspection since 2010 in Chicago. We have access to the name and location of the food insitution, the results of the test. We can find areas that tend to fail inspections and see how they compare with crime rate.  It can tell us if crimes are located in areas with good restaurants (might be richer areas) or bad ones (might be poorer areas).

- [Chicago taxi rides in 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-taxi-rides-2016):
This dataset contains taxi rides data such as location of picking and dropping, time of the course. This would allow us to see which areas of the city are well connected and which areas tend to be excluded. We can then try to correlate the results with the violent areas. However this analysis can only be possible for the 2016 year.

- [Chicago public dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/):
This website contains publicy available datasets for the city of Chicago. It could be a great way to complete our analysis. We can find data regarding different aspects of the city such as education, real estate, environment, cleanness... Findind how violent zones differ from each other regarding other aspects might lead us to find factors that reduce violence.

# Questions for TAa
Add here some questions you have for us, in general or project-specific.

- Should we restrict ourself to the crime dataset or is it a good idea to explore other Chicago related datasets (food inspections, taxis courses) to find correlations ?
